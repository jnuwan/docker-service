## Overview

The `docker-service` is a test project designed to demonstrate the integration of Docker and Jenkins. It provides a simple setup for building, deploying, and testing a Java application using Docker and Jenkins.

## Features

- Docker containerization for the application.
- Jenkins pipeline for CI/CD.
- Automated build and deployment process.
- Simple Java application for demonstration purposes.

## Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins
- **Build Tool**: Maven

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine
- Jenkins installed and running
- Java 11 or higher
- Maven

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jnuwan/docker-service.git
   cd docker-service
   ```

2. Build the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t docker-service .
   ```

### Running the Application

To run the application inside a Docker container, use the following command:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 docker-service
```

This will start the application and you can access it at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with it through the provided endpoints. Below are some example endpoints:

- `GET /api/hello`: Returns a greeting message.
- `POST /api/data`: Accepts and processes data.

## CI/CD with Jenkins

The repository includes a Jenkinsfile that defines the CI/CD pipeline. To set up the pipeline in Jenkins:

1. Create a new Jenkins job.
2. Choose "Pipeline" and configure the SCM to point to this repository.
3. Jenkins will automatically use the Jenkinsfile to define the pipeline stages.
